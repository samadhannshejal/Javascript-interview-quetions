1. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
   Explain how the event loop works and why it's important for asynchronous programming.
   Answer ▶️ Event loop in JavaScript is crucial mechanism for handling asynchronous operations . allowing JavaScript to perform 
             non-blocking task

   How its works ➡️ Call stack : JavaScript uses a call stack to keep track of functions to be executed .when function  is called
                                  is pushed into call stack , once it complete then it will be pop out from call stack
                 ➡️  Web APIs  : When asynchronous operations like setTimeout, HTTP requests,DOM event they are pushed into web 
                                 APIs for execution
                 ➡️ Task Queue: Once asynchronous operations are completed ,their corresponding callable function are pushed into 
                                 callback Queue
                 ➡️ Event loop: Event loop is continues monitoring call stack and call Queue, if  the call stack is empty , then 
                                event loop take the first task from Queue and push to call stack for execution
                 ➡️ Micro-task-Queue : Beside the task Queue ,there is micro task Queue for operations like promises , micro task
                                       having higher priority and executed task before main task Queue
